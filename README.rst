BoARIO : The Adaptative Regional Input Output model in python.

What is BoARIO ?
=================

BoARIO, is a python implementation project of the Adaptative Regional Input Output (ARIO) model [`Hallegatte 2013`_].

Its objectives are to give an accessible and inter-operable implementation of ARIO, as well as tools to visualize and analyze simulation outputs and to
evaluate the effects of many parameters of the model.

This implementation would not have been possible without the `Pymrio`_ module and amazing work of [`Stadler 2021`_] !

It is still an ongoing project (in parallel of a PhD project).

Here is a non-exhaustive chronology of academic works with or about the ARIO model :

Where to get it ?
===================

You can install BoARIO from ``pip`` with:

.. code:: console

   pip install boario


The full source code is also available on Github at: https://github.com/spjuhel/BoARIO

More info in the :ref:`installation page<installation>` of the documentation.

How does BoARIO work?
=========================

In a nutshell, BoARIO takes the following inputs :

- an IO table (such as EXIOBASE3 or EORA26) in the form of an :class:`pymrio.IOSystem` object.

- multiple parameters which govern the simulation,

- event(s) description(s), which are used as the perturbation to analyse during the simulation

And produce the following outputs:

- the step by step, sector by sector, region by region evolution of most of the variables involved in the simulation (`production`, `demand`, `stocks`, ...)

- aggregated indicators for the whole simulation (`shortages duration`, `aggregated impacts`, ...)

Example of use
=================

See :ref:`Boario quickstart<boario-quickstart>`.
