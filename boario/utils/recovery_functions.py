    Parameters
    ----------

    steep_factor: float
        This coefficient governs the slope of the central part of the s-shape, smaller values lead to a steeper slope.

A value of 0.000001 should insure 95% of the initial impact is rebuild for a reasonable range of recovery duration.

    half_recovery_time : int
        This can by use to change the time the inflexion point of the s-shape curve is attained. By default it is set to half the recovery duration.
